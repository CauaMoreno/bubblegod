## About the game:
This game was made at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF) headquarters for the Global Game Jam 2025. It consists of a collection of 3 games, which are linked in the historical context of the bubble war. The main game (from this repository) was programmed in Godot during the period from the 24th to the 26th!
